//Aim:
To write a Java program to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus using a menu-driven program and a switch statement.
    
//Algorithm:
Start the program.
Import the Scanner class to read input from the user.
Read two integer numbers.
Display the menu of arithmetic operations:
Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Division,Modulus
Exit
Read the user's choice.
Use a switch statement to perform the selected operation.
For division and modulus, check whether the second number is zero before performing the operation.
Display the result of the selected operation.
If the user chooses 6, display “Exiting...” and terminate the program.
If an invalid choice is entered, display an error message.
Repeat the process until the user chooses to exit.
Stop the program.
