#AIM:  
#To write a shell program to check whether a given number is even or odd. 
 
#ALGORITHM: 
#1. Read a number from the user. 
#2. Find the remainder when the number is divided by 2. 
#3. If the remainder is 0, display “Even”. 
#4. Otherwise, display “Odd”. 
 
#PROGRAM: 
#!/bin/bash 
echo "Enter a number:" 
read n 
if [ $((n % 2)) -eq 0 ] 
then 
  echo "The number is Even" 
else 
  echo "The number is Odd" 
fi 
 
#EXECUTION PROCEDURE: 
#1. Open the terminal. 
#2. Create a file using vi evenodd.sh. 
#3. Type the program and save the file. 
#4. Provide execute permission using chmod +x evenodd.sh. 
#5. Execute the program using ./evenodd.sh. 
 
 
#SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
#Enter a number: 
#6 
#The number is Even 
 
 
#RESULT: 
#Thus, the shell program to check whether a number is even or odd was executed 
#successfully.
