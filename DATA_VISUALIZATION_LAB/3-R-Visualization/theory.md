# Experiment 3: Basic Visualization in R

## Aim
To create line, bar, pie, scatter, and histogram graphs using base R.

## Theory
Base R includes plotting functions useful for learning visualization fundamentals without external packages. Vectors hold the data, while `plot()`, `barplot()`, `pie()`, and `hist()` map those values to visual marks. Titles and labels provide the context needed for interpretation.

## Algorithm
1. Create numeric and character vectors.
2. Choose a graph function based on the analytical purpose.
3. Pass the vectors to the function.
4. Add titles and axis labels.
5. Save the plots and interpret the pattern.

## Program Explanation
`program.R` uses the PDF graphics device so all five plots are generated reproducibly in one run. It uses only base R.

## Result
The five basic visualizations were generated successfully using R.

## Viva Prompts
1. What does `type = "o"` do in a base R plot?
2. How does `breaks` affect a histogram?
3. Which R function is used for categorical comparison?
